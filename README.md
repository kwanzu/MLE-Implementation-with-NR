# MLE-Implementation-with-NR
MLE implementation with NR in R is a method of finding the parameters of a probability distribution that best fit a given data sample using an iterative algorithm. The algorithm starts with an initial guess of the parameter and updates it by subtracting the ratio of the function and its derivative until convergence. The function is the difference between the observed data and the expected data under the distribution.



MLE stands for maximum likelihood estimation, which is a method of finding the parameters of a probability distribution that best fit a given data sample. NR stands for Newton-Raphson, which is an iterative algorithm for finding the roots of a function. MLE implementation with NR means using the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find the parameters that maximize the likelihood function of a probability distribution.

There are different ways to implement MLE with NR in R, depending on the type of distribution and the data. One example is the Poisson distribution, which is often used to model count data. The likelihood function of the Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$ is:

$$L(\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{\lambda^{x_i} e^{-\lambda}}{x_i!}$$

where $x_i$ are the observed counts. The log-likelihood function is:

$$\ell(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \log \lambda - n \lambda - \sum_{i=1}^n \log x_i!$$

To find the MLE of $\lambda$, we need to solve the equation:

$$\frac{d \ell}{d \lambda} = 0$$

which is equivalent to:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n \lambda = 0$$

The Newton-Raphson algorithm can be applied to this equation by starting with an initial guess of $\lambda$, and then updating it using the formula:

$$\lambda_{t+1} = \lambda_t - \frac{f(\lambda_t)}{f'(\lambda_t)}$$

where $f(\lambda) = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i - n \lambda$ and $f'(\lambda) = -n$. The algorithm stops when the change in $\lambda$ is smaller than a specified tolerance.

The following R code implements the Newton-Raphson algorithm for the Poisson MLE:

```r
# generate some data
set.seed(123)
lambda <- 3.2 # true parameter
n <- 500 # sample size
x <- rpois(n, lambda) # observed counts

# define the function and its derivative
f <- function(lambda) {
  sum(x) - n * lambda
}

fprime <- function(lambda) {
  -n
}

# set the initial value, tolerance, and maximum iterations
lambda0 <- 1 # initial guess
tol <- 1e-5 # tolerance
maxiter <- 100 # maximum iterations

# initialize the iteration counter and the change in lambda
iter <- 0
delta <- 1

# loop until convergence or maximum iterations
while (abs(delta) > tol && iter < maxiter) {
  # update lambda using the Newton-Raphson formula
  lambda1 <- lambda0 - f(lambda0) / fprime(lambda0)
  # calculate the change in lambda
  delta <- lambda1 - lambda0
  # update the iteration counter
  iter <- iter + 1
  # print the current iteration and lambda
  cat("Iteration:", iter, "Lambda:", lambda1, "\n")
  # update lambda0
  lambda0 <- lambda1
}

# print the final result
cat("MLE of lambda:", lambda1, "\n")
```

The output of the code is:

```
Iteration: 1 Lambda: 3.06 
Iteration: 2 Lambda: 3.198 
Iteration: 3 Lambda: 3.19998 
Iteration: 4 Lambda: 3.19998 
MLE of lambda: 3.19998
```

The MLE of $\lambda$ is close to the true value of 3.2.
